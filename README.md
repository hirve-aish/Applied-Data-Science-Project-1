###### Predicting Average Daily Taxi Fare Price in NYC  
###### Based on weather conditions, and taxi type  

Improvements in smartphone technology and internet connectivity have led to the rise of ride sharing and ride hailing apps such as Uber, Lyft, and Via. More and more people in New York City (NYC) are choosing to opt for such For Hire Vehicles (FHV) over traditional Yellow Medallion Taxis; this for a number of reasons including competitive pricing offered by FHVs, and the added convenience of being able to hail a taxi via an app as opposed to physically hailing a Yellow Taxi on the road.

In today’s business world, companies that can offer services at the lowest market price, or ‘floor price’ attract more customers and remain competitive in the market.

This report will assume the perspective of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commision (NYCTLC), and will aim to predict the average daily taxi fare price for Yellow Medallion Taxis, and 4 types of FHV taxis (Uber, Juno, Lyft, Via) based on trip factors (pick up location, date, trip distance, etc), and ambient weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind speed). Relevant recommendations to the NYCTLC about its fare pricing compared to other taxi companies.
